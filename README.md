# DataMiningAssignments

The jupyter notebooks in this repository contain my solutions to assignments for the graduate course CISC 873 at Queens University. Each assignment was given as a Kaggle commetition. The general organization of all notebooks is summarized below along with the content of each notebook.

## Summary of Content

`Speed_Dating_Prediciton.ipynb`
The goal of this notebook is to examine both categorial and continuous speed dateing information to make predictions of the success of the date. The notebook contains sklearn pipelines which preprocess and execute hyper parameter tuning of both the XGBoost and Adaboost Models. 

`X_Ray_Image_Classification.ipynb`
The goal of this notebook is to examine X-Ray image data to predicit if the X-Ray is COVID-19 positive or negative. CNNs are explored in addtion to transfer learning of preexisting state of the art models. 

`Multi_Objective_Multi_Modal_Input_Prediciton.ipynb`
The goal of this notebook is to examine house listing data given as both images and text descriptions. Both multi-objective and multi-modal models are explored to best pridict the listing price of the house. RNNs such as LSTMs and attention models are explored, as well as CNNs for the image data. 

`Graph_Neural_Networks.ipynb`
The goal of this notebook is to examine chemical compounds to determine if they are positive agianst non-small cell lung cancer. Different GCN aggregation mechanisms are tested as well as sampling techniques.
